# VIXL Line emoji pack

`artwork.zip` holds the artwork Vixl draws for emojis in text: `svg/<key>.svg` for every entry and
`vixl/<key>.vixl` editable masters. Vixl keeps the small catalog (`src/vixl/data/emojis/catalog.json`)
in the engine and downloads this archive the first time it draws an emoji, then caches it in
`~/.cache/vixl/packs/`. See Vixl's [emoji guide](https://github.com/jxburros/Vixl/blob/main/docs/emojis.md)
for installing it ahead of time or offline.

Licenses: the Unicode artwork is adapted from OpenMoji and, with the 100 VIXL originals, is licensed under
[CC BY-SA 4.0](LICENSE.txt). Unicode data is under the [Unicode license](UNICODE-LICENSE.txt).

## Updating the pack

   `python packs/emojis/build_pack.py --sources /path/to/sources`
2. Copy the new `catalog.json` to Vixl's `src/vixl/data/emojis/`.
3. Commit `artwork.zip` here, then update `PACK_COMMIT` and `PACK_SHA256` in Vixl's `src/vixl/emojis.py`
   to the new commit and `sha256sum packs/emojis/artwork.zip`.
